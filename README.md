This project focuses on analyzing a dataset to uncover insights about students’ habits and their impact on Cumulative Grade Point Average (CGPA). The process started with data cleaning, where inconsistencies were removed, missing values were addressed, and the data was prepared for analysis. Insights were then derived from the cleaned data by examining correlations between lifestyle factors and academic performance. Finally, I visualized my insights on an interactive Tableau dashboard to highlight key trends and derive actionable steps. 

The analysis revealed several significant insights. Students getting more than 8 hours of sleep tend to have the highest CGPAs, while a healthy diet was positively associated with better academic performance. Low financial stress correlated with higher CGPAs, while the opposite significantly reduced academic performance. Additionally, the optimal study duration was found to be approximately 5 hours per day, balancing effort and effectiveness. Finally, high academic expectations were linked to better performance, but need to be paired with healthy habits for maximum results.
Based on these findings, certain insights can be pulled out. Namely, students should maintain high but manageable academic expectations and focus on a balanced lifestyle that includes sufficient sleep, healthy eating, and stress management. Moderate studying, such as studying for 5 hours daily, were recommended for optimal performance. 
I believe that students like myself could make use of these insights to maximize academic performance. Furthermore, educational institutions should implement programs to reduce financial stress and promote healthier lifestyles among students, These would no doubt improve financial, mental, and of course, academic well-being.
